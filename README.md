# or
hk-save-logger hk 1
```

Monitor Silksong save slot 2:

```bash
hk-save-logger silksong 2
# or
hk-save-logger ss 2
```

Monitor a specific save file:

```bash
hk-save-logger --path /path/to/your/save/user1.dat
```

### Encoding/Decoding

Decode a save file to JSON:

```bash
hk-save-logger --path /path/to/save.dat
# or
hk-save-logger ss 1
```

Encode a modified JSON file back to save format (`.dat`):

```bash
hk-save-logger --path /path/to/save.dat --encode
```

Command Line Options

```text
Usage: hk-save-logger [OPTIONS] [GAME] [SAVE]

Arguments:
  [GAME]  Game to parse (hollow-knight/hk or silksong/ss) [possible values: hollow-knight, silksong]
  [SAVE]  Save slot to parse (1-4)

Options:
      --encode       Decode save file (default) or encode (it won't place the file for you, you have to do it manually, this is done to prevent data loss. Rename file to user1.dat (or whatever number you need) and place it in the correct folder)
      --path <PATH>  Path to save file (default: auto-detect)
  -h, --help         Print help
  -V, --version      Print version
```

## Save File Locations

The tool automatically detects save file locations for both games and both Steam
and GOG:

-   Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Team Cherry\`
-   macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/`
-   Linux: `~/.config/unity3d/Team Cherry/`

## Output Files

The tool creates (or appends to) two files:

-   `{game}-{save}.json` - JSON representation of the save file
-   `{game}-{save}.log` - Log of all changes detected

## Bugs

If you find any bugs, please [open an
issue](https://github.com/zohnannor/hk-save-logger/issues/new) and describe your
problem.

## Known Issues

-   Insertion of a new value into the middle of an array is rendered as a change
    to all the subsequent values
